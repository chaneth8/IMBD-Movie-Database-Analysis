# IMBD-Movie-Database-Analysis
I analyzed the following data from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luizpaulodeoliveira/imdb-project-sql using SQL (SQLite specifically) and Python.

### Note: 
I used the library plotly for some of my graphs, which does not render properly on Github. Copying the link of the Juypter notebook into this webpage: https://nbviewer.org/ should solve the issue.
